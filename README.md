For the development of the FACAMP Engineering Integration Project (PIEF III), of the Computer Engineering course, the development of a system was proposed of Database Management (SGBD), relying on the Database disciplines Data and Human-Machine Interfaces.<BR>

## PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED
In a conventional Medicine, it is necessary to register doctors, patients, queries, medicines, cet. We know that to carry out such actions, we face a very bureaucratic and inefficient system.

## SOLUTION
* With the aim of facilitating such registrations, also thinking about the need to carry it out through social distancing in a pandemic context, the program was developed to manage a registration system and visualize queries and results.
* The developed system is aimed at Conventional Medicine and aims to be implemented in a small office, in order to resolve real everyday situations.
* In this way, integrating the project with a Database, it was possible to carry out a system that served both doctors and patients.
* The system has a login page, area to check the patient's report, information for the doctor and various other functionalities.

## OBSERVATION
* Connection to the Database is necessary for the system to function normally.
* Field researches were carried out before starting the project.
